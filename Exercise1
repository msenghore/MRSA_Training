Mapping reads to a reference genome 

The files for this exeercise are in the cluster, copy the contents of the Training folder to your local scratch area

/n/holylfs05/LABS/hanage_lab/Lab/holyscratch01/madikay/Training/
In there are two folders:
raw_reads/
reference/

## Before we start lets have a look at Staphylococcus aureus reference genomes that are present in the Sanger institute repositories
https://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/downloads/bacteria/staphylococcus-aureus.html

For this example we will use the USA300 MRSA genome from texas USA300_TCH1516
link to reference genome: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/CP000730.1
Link to original research article on paper: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17986343/

Step 1: Identify the tool you want to use for mapping
We will use bwa as a case example, but you can use other methods

Bwa user manual: http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/bwa.shtml
we will go through the specific code for these steps together
1) Index the reference genome
2) Optional step: trim the sequenced reads
3) Map the reads to the reference genome
4) Figure out how to loop it to do all samples (script or a dirty one-liner)

## Create softl ink to files in your space
ln -s /n/holylfs05/LABS/hanage_lab/Lab/holyscratch01/madikay/Training/* .

module load bwa

## Example script
bwa mem -p ../reference/CP000730_USA300_TCH1516.fasta 1133_2P_.R1.fq > 1133_2P_.sam

### Now lets loop through
1) List all your read files in a text file
ls | grep fq | xargs -n 2 > reads.list

2) Loop through the text file, extract sample names and run mapping for each one
while read i; do IFS='.' read -r -a f <<< "$i"; sbatch -p shared  -t 7000 --mem=4000 --wrap="bwa mem ../reference/CP000730_USA300_TCH1516.fasta $i > ../sam/$f.sam"; done < reads.list

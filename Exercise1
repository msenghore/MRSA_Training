Mapping reads to a reference genome 

The files for this exeercise are in the cluster, copy the contents of the Training folder to your local scratch area

/n/holylfs05/LABS/hanage_lab/Lab/holyscratch01/madikay/Training/
In there are two folders:
raw_reads/
reference/

## Before we start lets have a look at Staphylococcus aureus reference genomes that are present in the Sanger institute repositories
https://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/downloads/bacteria/staphylococcus-aureus.html

For this example we will use the USA300 MRSA genome from texas USA300_TCH1516

Link to original research article on paper: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17986343/

Step 1: Identify the tool you want to use for mapping
We will use bwa as a case example, but you can use other methods

Bwa user manual: http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/bwa.shtml
we will go through the specific code for these steps together
1) Index the reference genome
2) Optional step: trim the sequenced reads
3) Map the reads to the reference genome
4) Figure out how to loop it to do all samples (script or a dirty one-liner)
